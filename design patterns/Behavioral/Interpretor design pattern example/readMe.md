## Requirements:

implement an Pool for Database Connections, where we reuse connections instead of creating new ones every time.

## Definition of Interpreter design pattern:

is a behavioral design pattern used to define a grammar for a language and provide an interpreter to process sentences in that language. 
It is useful when you need to evaluate expressions, parse languages, or process commands dynamically.

## When to use Interpreter design pattern:

✅ When you need to evaluate expressions or parse a language (e.g., SQL, regex, mathematical expressions).  </br>
✅ When you have a known set of grammar rules that can be represented as a tree structure.  </br>
✅ When implementing scripting languages, command processing, or simple compilers. </br>
