## Requirements:

Implement a custom sequential iterator for a Country containing States.

## Definition of Iterator design pattern:

The Iterator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying structure.

## When to use Iterator design pattern:

✅ When you need to traverse a collection without exposing its internal structure. </br>
✅ When your collection should support multiple ways of iteration (e.g., forward, backward). </br>
✅ When you want to provide a uniform way to iterate over different collections. </br>

## Benefits of using Iterator design pattern:

✅ Encapsulation – The client does not need to know the internal data structure. </br>
✅ Flexibility – You can change the collection structure without affecting iteration logic. </br>
✅ Supports Different Iteration Types – You can implement forward, reverse, or custom iterators. </br>
