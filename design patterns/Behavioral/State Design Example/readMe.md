## State Diagram

## Definition of State pattern

A behavioral software design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

## Benefits

-  Cleaner Code: Reduces complex if-else or switch statements.
-  Extensibility: Adding new states requires minimal changes to existing code.
-  Encapsulation: State-specific behavior is encapsulated within individual state classes.
-  Improved Maintenance: Changes to one state's behavior donâ€™t affect others.
