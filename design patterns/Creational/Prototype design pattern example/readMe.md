## Definition of Prototype design pattern

It's a creational design pattern that allows objects to be cloned to create new instances. 
Instead of creating new objects from scratch, the Prototype Pattern creates new objects by copying an existing object (prototype). 
This is particularly useful when object creation is expensive or complex.
